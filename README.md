# Eye Exercise
This is a fun example of how to capture the **onMouseMove()** event to interact with the DOM. When you move the mouse, the eyes follow it like a person or an animal.

## Future Improvements
I had no problem developing this code. This is a good example to motivate kids to code, so some improvements that I will make later will be:
* Add animal features such as muzzle, ears, suddenly hair.
* Add gestures that simulate emotions, in addition to just follow you with its eyes, that it has a certain movement such as shaking or yawning, which makes you feel that it is alive.
